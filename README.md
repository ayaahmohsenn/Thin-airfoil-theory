# Thin-airfoil-theory
This code applies a concept in rotor aero dynamics which is called "Thin Airfoil Theory"
Thin airfoil theory is a theory that relates the angle of attack alpha to the Lift coefficient. Thin
airfoil theory depends on zero thickness cambered airfoil y(x) that faces free stream velocity V∞
with a specific angle of attack α along the chord line C.
